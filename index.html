<h1> Arron’s bike ride </h1>

<p>yes I had my bike ride and it was really good! They have closed access to all of the walks because I think too many people were going on walks but taking there cars causing congestion. There are a lot of people walking, cycling and I am not over exaggerating that.</p>
